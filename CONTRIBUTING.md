# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the our [code of conduct].

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by using alpha, beta, and prerelease versions
* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing specifications

## Submitting an Issue

* We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features.
* Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
  already been submitted.
* When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][] that includes a stack
  trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including
  your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system.  Ideally, a bug report
  should include a pull request with failing specs.

## Cleaning up issues

* Issues that have no response from the submitter will be closed after 30 days.
* Issues will be closed once they're assumed to be fixed or answered. If the
  maintainer is wrong, it can be opened again.
* If your issue is closed by mistake, please understand and explain the issue.
  We will happily reopen the issue.
